## Retrospective (aka yapping)
I'm really proud of the design I created. Its a futuristic mechanical theme! 

I had a bit of trouble fiddling with CSS modules. I'm unsure how to make full use of theming with colors.module.css when I cannot use composes with standard elements (like html, button, div). Guess I would have to link it from index.html. Actually thats probably it.

I'm also thinking my testing is not comprehensive enough. I will try to test more cases and read some more testing code.
